# Critical Updates

This program gets webhooks from Zendesk when tickets are updated.

Much of the business logic is specific to how we use Zendesk. 

The program has two chunks of functionality: 
* Handling subscriptions for CriticalUpdates.
* Creating new KB articles from specific customer-facing updates.

## Handling Critical Updates
Upon receiving a webhook, the program checks whether the ticket's critical update field is set.
If so, 
* it updates the list of followers in Zendesk with the IDs of the AE and SA.
* it updates that ticket's tags to include a tag to indicate that ticket has been processed.
If the critical update field is not set, but the processed tag exists, that tag is deleted and the ticket is updated.

## Creating new KB articles: 
* check to see if the generate tage is set, and the creasted tag is NOT set. 
* Check to see if the ticket's status is SOLVED 
* Find the Closing Summary (from the beginning of the ticket.)
* Map the summary fields to the troubleshooting KB Template
* Create the Draft KB
* Update the ticket (add kb_created tag)
* Send an email to the ticketâ€™s owner

## How to install the program on your local Mac
* Checkout the code `git clone https://github.com/rcprcp/CriticalUpdates.git`
* `cd Criticalupdates`
* `mvn clean package`  This should create a standalone jar file with all dependencies.
* You will need to set up the following shell variables (or configure IntelliJ RUn profile) for credentials.
  * ZENDESK_USER
  * ZENDESK_TOKEN
  * ZENDESK_URL
  * MJ_APIKEY_PUBLIC
  * MJ_APIKEY_PRIVATE
  
* `java -jar target/CriticalUpdates-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

## How to test:
These instructions are for setting up a local (on your Mac) testing environment.
In this way you can use the Intellij debugger, or even use something like YourKit profiler
in order to check the application's performance. 

* for very simple local testing just starr the program and use curl: 
`curl -v -X POST http://localhost:5002/zendesk/comment -d '{"ticketId" : 131188}'`

For testign with Zendesk Webhooks - 
* Get ngrok `https://ngrok.com/` (only need to do this once) :)
* Start ngrok (`ngrok http 5000`) This will return an "ngrok" url to which we should send the Zendesk Webhooks.
* Start the app standalone: `java -jar target/CriticalUpdates-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` or in the Intellij Debugger 
* Update (or create) the Zendesk webhook that will send the webhook request to our application - currently the only field that is used from the WebHook is the ticketId.
* The program should start to get updates via Webhooks when Zendesk Tickets are updated.
* You can check on the status of the process via the healthcheck report `https://localhost:5002/health`
